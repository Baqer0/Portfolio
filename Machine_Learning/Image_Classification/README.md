# Image Classification

**Project Overview**
This project involves building a robust machine learning model to classify images of chocolate as either white chocolate or dark chocolate. Using a combination of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and fine-tuning techniques, the model leverages transfer learning to achieve high accuracy on this specialized classification task. The dataset includes labeled images of white and dark chocolate, enabling the model to learn the visual differences between the two types of chocolate.

The primary goal is to develop an accurate and efficient image classification system that can distinguish between white and dark chocolate images. This model can be integrated into applications such as automated product categorization or quality assurance in the chocolate industry.

**Key Features:**
- **Image Classification Model:** A pre-trained CNN serves as the backbone of the classification model, fine-tuned on the chocolate dataset to improve performance for the specific task.

- **Accurate Chocolate Type Identification:** Classifies input images into "White Chocolate" or "Dark Chocolate"

- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes a pre-trained model like MobileNet, adapted to detect subtle differences between the two chocolate types.

- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix ensure the reliability of the classification model.

**Technologies Used:**
**Python:** For developing and training the machine learning model.
**TensorFlow/Keras:** To implement the pre-trained CNN and add custom layers.
**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** To visualize model performance and data insights.
**Dataset:** A custom dataset of labeled images of white and dark chocolate.
